# ESTETIKA-LANDING-PAGE

Welcome to the `ESTETIKA-LANDING-PAGE` branch! This branch focuses on the development of the ESTETIKA platform's landing page using React.JS, specifically Next.JS.

## Introduction

The `ESTETIKA-LANDING-PAGE` branch is dedicated to designing and developing the landing page for the ESTETIKA platform. This includes user interfaces, user experience (UI/UX) design, and content presentation. The landing page provides information about Estetika and allows users to download the mobile application directly from the website.

## Technologies Used

The landing page is built using Next.JS, a React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.

## Getting Started

To run the Estetika landing page locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone -b ESTETIKA-LANDING-PAGE https://github.com/ESTETIKA-2023/ESTETIKA-CC.git
   ```
   
3. Navigate to the `ESTETIKA-CC` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ESTETIKA-CC
   ```
   
4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The landing page will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
